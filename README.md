is an event-driven RTC (Run To Completion) scheduler dedicated to ultra constrained IoT devices.

RTC OS is written in pure C and doesn't need any thirdparty library or dependency to work.

Being hardware agnostic, RTC OS can work on any hardware platform that can provide a hardware timer tick and optionally an interface to enter and exit critical section.
